# A-Frame WordPress Blog

A project to turn [www.nateliason.com](http://www.nateliason.com) into a VR experience.

Built using A-Frame and Rails, importing existing blog posts and displaying them in VR environments.

## Any Suggestions?

For any suggestions you might have, please let me know on Twitter at [@nateliason](http://www.twitter.com/nateliason), or simply submit a pull request here. Suggestions on improving the code are more than welcome, I'm very new to this. 

## Things That Don't Work Well Currently

* Displaying text is ugly in VR views. This is largely a resolution problem.
* Longer articles come out ugly, probably because of my display method, but I'm working on it.
* Clicking can sometimes trigger at random times, this seems especially common on less VR-forward browsers (Get it together Apply).
